# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)


---

## ✅ **Project Description**

This project implements a supervised machine learning pipeline to predict diabetes occurrence based on patient health records. It involves end-to-end steps including data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. The model leverages Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification and provides insights into how health metrics relate to diabetes risk. The project also showcases exploratory data analysis to understand data distribution, correlation among features, and the characteristics of diabetic vs. non-diabetic groups.
